*tradingbot-node* is an Alpha version and I want to do some refactoring to clean the code and improve its scalability, so
if you are inspired and you desire to contribute, you are welcome!<br/>
## General info
This trading bot is written to do automatic and algorithmic trading on the crypto market based on a given strategy.<br/>
My own strategy is runnning 24/7 and it's deployed on Heroku.

The are 2 main services:
* **BacktestingService** : It's used to test your strategy on hystorical data downloaded with Binance's API.
* **TradingService** : It's used to run your strategy in the real envirorment! Good Luck ;)
